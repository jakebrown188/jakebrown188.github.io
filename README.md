# Jake's Tech Journey

This blog is currently hosted at https://www.jakestechjourney.com

This is my personal blog to document and share various topics that I am exploring and learning about. I've realized that the best way to learn something is to teach it. My hope for this blog is that it provides me with the benefit to learn through teaching and provides you with the benefit of learning the topics I am exploring. 

Some of my current blog ideas are:
- Exploring the OWASP Top 10 in depth
- Automating the creation of VMs with Packer
- Diving into the RFCs of network protocols such as DNS, QUIC, and SMTP
- Contributing to major open source projects such as Apache Tomcat
